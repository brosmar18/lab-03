            <p>My name is Bryan Osmar Garduno Gonzalez. I was born in Mexico City, Mexico and grew up in a small town called Temascalcingo, Queretaro. My family moved to the US in 2005. I was 9 years old. I started 4th grade in Cleveland Elementary School that year without knowing a single word of English. Learning simple sentences like "Where is the bathroom?", became pretty life changing at that time.</p>
            <p>Most of my work experience has been in healthcare. I graduated high school in 2014 and I was sure my dream was to work in a hospital. Until I actually worked in a hospital and realized it was actually a nighmare. After attending 2 out of 4 semesters of nursing school, I took some time off to find something I was actually passionate about. That's when I discovered programming. Now, my number one goal is to become a Software Engineer.</p>
